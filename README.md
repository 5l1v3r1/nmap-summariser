# nmapsumariser - another nmap summarising script
There are many ways to summarise nmap output. I am a fan of cat | grep | cut usually.
I had a need to spit out scans in a specific format so that is what it does.
Feel free to modify the output to suit your needs since the hard part of getting the XML attributes is done.
# Pre-Requisites
None. Should run wherever python runs.
